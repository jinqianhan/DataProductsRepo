This application is like a cheat sheet for people who are wondering what statistical tests they should use for their collected data


It is extremely simple to use, given the user has a basic understanding of statistics and data.

#### Viewing the examples

First, users can decide whether to view 2 examples:
        * linreg
        * ttest
by checking the appropriate radio button and clicking submit. The default parameters need not be altered.
The result are example data sets that would be analyzed by linear regression or a Student's t-test, in addition to plotting the graphs and displaying the relevant statistics.

#### Using the App

The user must then check "no" to the show examples radio widget in order to begin using the application.
Unfortunately, the ability to upload data and run statistical tests like a statistical calculator would has not been implemented yet.

The user must know the nature of their dependent and independent variables. The more the user knows about their data, the better the app would be able to return a proper statistical test.
briefly, categorical variables are any variables that do not take on numeric values, eg. automatic vs manual transmission, exposure vs no exposure to chemicals, etc.

numeric variables are usually continuous variables (can take any value) such as blood pressure, income, velocity, distance, etc.

The user should also know if their data is paired or normal, but that is not always immediately obvious.
Finally, the user should input the number of groups they are analyzing. If it is simply a control vs a treatment, the number of groups is the defaulted 2. If the sample is paired or matched,
the number of groups would be 1 (or sometimes it may not matter).

Finally, the user clicks submit, and the app will display the parameters of the data type, then output the correct statistical test to use.
